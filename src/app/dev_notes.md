After 2 years of development (mostly procrastination lol), finally version 2.0 released into the wild. Again, it's still in BETA, meaning there are bugs lurking in the dark waiting to be found. Expect the unexpected.

### Known Issues:

- Backup feature does not work with big collection (more than 1 GB)
- Live Wallpaper failed to re-apply itself upon device restart on some devices
