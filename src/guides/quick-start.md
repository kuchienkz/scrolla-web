# Quick Start

In order to use Scrolla Wallpaper, basically you have to:

2.  Make a Playlist,
3.  Add some Wallpaper Resources to the Playlist,
4.  And lastly, start the Wallpaper Service

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

## Creating Wallpaper Resources

When you import an image file into the app, it became a **Wallpaper Resource**. Basically, wallpaper resource is a entity that contains not just your wallpaper image, but also it's configuration. For simplicity, we will simply call it **Wallpaper** onward.

Now let's make some Wallpapers from image files.

### 1. Go to Resources Page

Here you will find more resource types, but for now we will focus on adding Wallpapers.

On the Resources page, tap on the round, 3-lines button, then select **Add Wallpapers**. A file picking dialog should appear, select any images you want (unsupported images will be hidden), and then click Add.

### 2. Configure Wallpapers

After picking some images, you will automatically directed to Wallpaper configuration page.

There is so much you can do here, but for now let's simply do the necessary, which is declaring the [**Content Safety**](legals/content-safety-tag) tag.

On the **Tags** section, tap on the pencil icon on the right. On the Content Safety field, select whichever suit your Wallpaper the most (if in doubt, select NSFW). Then tap on the Save button. You have to do this for every Wallpaper.

Once you are done, tap on the Save button above to start importing your images into the app. Scrolla Wallpaper make a copy for every images and place it on it's [**Working Directory**](configurations/working-directory), so you can safely delete the source images if you want.
