2.  Make a Playlist
3.  Set it as Live Wallpaper

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

## Creating Wallpaper Resources

When you import an image file into the app, it became a **Wallpaper Resource**. Basically, wallpaper resource is a entity that contains not just your wallpaper image, but also it's configuration. For simplicity, we will simply call it **Wallpaper** onward.

Now let's make some Wallpapers from image files.

### 1. Go to Resources Page

Here you will find more resource types, but for now we will focus on adding Wallpapers.

On the Resources page, tap on the round, 3-lines button, then select **Add Wallpapers**. A file picking dialog should appear, select any images you want (unsupported images will be hidden), and then click Add.

### 2. Configure Wallpapers

After picking some images, you will automatically directed to Wallpaper configuration page.

There is so much you can do here, but for now let's simply do the necessary, which is declaring the [**Content Safety**](../legals/content-safety-tag) tag.

On the **Tags** section, tap on the pencil icon on the right. On the Content Safety field, select whichever suit your Wallpaper the most (if in doubt, select NSFW). Then tap on the Save button. You have to do this for every Wallpaper.

Once you are done, tap on the Save button above to start importing your images into the app. Scrolla Wallpaper make a copy for every images and place it inside [**Working Directory**](configurations/working-directory), so you can safely delete the source images if you want.

## Making Playlist

Go to Playlist Collection page, then tap on the Plus button above. Pick a unique Playlist name, then tap on Create. An empty Playlist will be created.

Next, open the Playlist by tapping on the middle of it, then tap on Plus button. On the Wallpaper Selection page, the previously added wallpapers should be there, tap on any wallpaper you wish to add to this Playlist. When done, tap on the Save button above.

Return to Playlist Collection page, under the cover image of non-empty Playlist, you should see a switch. Tap this switch to enable or disable the Playlist. Newly created Playlist are disabled by default.

## Finally, set it as Live Wallpaper

On Playlist Collection page, ensure that there are at least one Playlist enabled, then tap on the button at top-left corner. This will bring you to Live Wallpaper preview page. Tap button on the bottom, decide whether to use Scrolla Wallpaper just on Home Screen or both on Home Screen and Lock Screen.

## Done!
